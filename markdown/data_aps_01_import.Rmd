# Overview {#overview}

The DETECT screening tool was pilot tested between 2015-09-17 and 2015-10-26. On 2016-08-31 APS securely transmitted data containing records of all elder abuse and neglect investigations conducted in MedStar's service area between 2015-09-17 and 2015-11-05. Specifically, the name of the data set received from APS is:

* **APS In-Home Intakes of Clients Age 65 or Over in Denton Johnson or Tarrant Counties.xlsx** - This is the data that was sent to me by APS. It contains all the investigations conducted in MedStar's service area during the pilot study period.

Below we clean this data and prepare it for further analysis.


# Key variable definitions {#key}

It's important to understand the meaning of patient, and perpetrator, identification variables in the data. Additonally, it's important to understand these identifiers are related across the various sheets of the Excel file that APS sent us. The following diagram shows how people are identified in the MedStar data:

![](../images/aps_identifiers.png)

* **Case number definition**

    - APS case / investigation number.

* **Intake stage definition**

    - An ID number assigned to the Intake. Each Intake (Report to APS) has its own number. A case may have more than one intake. For example, on the first tab of the spreadsheet, you can see that case # XXXXXX has two intakes associated with it, 9 days apart, each with their own ID number. On the second tab of the spreadsheet, which provides allegations associated with each intake, you can see that each of the two intakes associated with this case have multiple allegations.

* **Intake start definition**

    - An intake is the submission or receipt of a report of abuse - a phone call or web-based. The Intake Start Date refers to the date the staff member opens a new record to begin recording the report. In the case of a phone call they have picked up from a caller on the abuse hotline, the intake starts when the Intake worker begins to speak to the individual, open the record and begin recording what they are hearing. In the case of reports made using the web-based system, intake begins when the Intake worker pulls the web-report and begins processing it in the system. There is the possibility that the intake may begin on one day but not end until the next day.


# Load packages and data {#load}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)
Sys.setenv(TZ = "US/Central")
```

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)

```










# Import APS client info data {#client-info}   

```{r}
path <- "/Volumes/Detect/APS In-Home Intakes of Clients Age 65 or Over in Denton Johnson or Tarrant Counties.xlsx"
```

The client info data contains patient identifiers.

```{r import_client_info}
col_info <- c( 
# "col_name",     "col_type"
  "case_num",     "text",
  "intake_stage", "text",
  "intake_start", "date",
  "full_name",    "text",
  "first_name",   "text",
  "middle_name",  "text",
  "last_name",    "text",
  "age",          "numeric",
  "dob",          "date",
  "county",       "text",
  "address",      "text",
  "city",         "text",
  "zip",          "text")

# Import data
client_data <- read_excel(
  path = path,
  sheet = "Client Data",
  col_names = col_info[seq(1, length(col_info), 2)],
  col_types = col_info[seq(2, length(col_info), 2)],
  skip = 6)

rm(col_info)

about_data(client_data) # 747 observations and 13 variables
```

## Check for duplicate rows by case number

```{r}
client_data %>% 
  group_by(case_num) %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.),         # 58
    `Number of Duplicate Rows by Case Number` = sum(n) # 68
  )
```

## Check for duplicate rows by case number and intake_stage

```{r}
client_data %>% 
  group_by(case_num, intake_stage) %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) # 0
```

## Check dates

```{r}
client_data %>% 
  summarise(
    `Earliest Date` = min(intake_start), # 2015-09-17
    `Latest Date` = max(intake_start)    # 2015-11-05
  )
```


## Standardize character strings

Because we will merge this data with other data sets in the future based on character strings (e.g., name), we need to go ahead and standardize their formats here. This will prevent mismatches during the merges. Specifically, we:

1. Transform all characters to lower case   
2. Remove any special characters (e.g., hyphens, periods)   
3. Remove trailing spaces (e.g., "John Smith ")   
4. Remove double spaces (e.g., "John  Smith")  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Examples for data checking
# client_data %>%
#   select(case_num, full_name, first_name, middle_name, last_name, address, city) %>%
#   filter(
#     # Special characters other than spaces
#     stringr::str_detect(full_name, "[^a-zA-Z\\d\\s]") |
#     stringr::str_detect(address, "[^a-zA-Z\\d\\s]") |
# 
#     # Trailing space
#     stringr::str_detect(full_name, "[[:blank:]]$") |
#     stringr::str_detect(address, "[[:blank:]]$") |
# 
#     # Double (or more) space
#     stringr::str_detect(full_name, "[[:blank:]]{2,}") |
#     stringr::str_detect(address, "[[:blank:]]{2,}")
#   )
```

```{r}
vars <- quos(full_name, first_name, middle_name, last_name, county, address, city)

client_data <- client_data %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(!!! vars), tolower) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(!!! vars), stringr::str_replace_all, "[^a-zA-Z\\d\\s]", " ") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(!!! vars), stringr::str_replace, "[[:blank:]]$", "") %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(!!! vars), stringr::str_replace_all, "[[:blank:]]{2,}", " ")

rm(vars)
```


## Reformat zip code 

Make zip code 5 digits for joining with MedStar data

```{r}
client_data <- client_data %>% 
  mutate(zip = stringr::str_extract(zip, "\\d{5}"))
```

```{r}
about_data(client_data) # 747 observations and 13 variables
```

# Import APS [allegations](http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/handbooks/APS/Files/APS_pg_1340.asp#APS_1340) data {#allegations}

The allegations data contains information about the allegation type(s) for each case and the perpetrator (self/other) for each allegation.

```{r import_allegations}
col_info <- c( 
# "col_name",     "col_type"
  "case_num",     "text",
  "intake_stage", "text",
  "allegation",   "text",
  "perp",         "text",
  "perp_id",      "text"
)

# Import data
allegations <- read_excel(
  path = path,
  sheet = "Allegations",
  col_names = col_info[seq(1, length(col_info), 2)],
  col_types = col_info[seq(2, length(col_info), 2)],
  skip = 6)

rm(col_info)

about_data(allegations) # 1,087 observations and 5 variables
```


## Sort data by case number and intake stage

```{r}
allegations <- allegations %>% 
  arrange(case_num, intake_stage)
```


## Check for duplicate rows by case number

```{r}
allegations %>% 
  group_by(case_num) %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.),         # 245
    `Number of Duplicate Rows by Case Number` = sum(n) # 408
  )
```

There are 245 case numbers that appear in the data 2 or more times.


## Check for duplicate rows by case number and intake stage

```{r}
allegations %>% 
  group_by(case_num, intake_stage) %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases/Intake Stages with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.), # 237
    `Number of Duplicate Rows` = sum(n)                      # 340
  )
```

There are 237 combinations of case number and intake stage that appear in the data 2 or more times. This happens when multiple allegations are mode at a single report (intake stage) for a case. Some cases have more than one reporter.


## Check for duplicate rows by case number, intake stage, and allegation

```{r}
allegations %>% 
  group_by(case_num, intake_stage, allegation) %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases/Intake Stages/Allegations with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.), # 80
    `Number of Duplicate Rows` = sum(n)                                  # 90
  )
```

There are 80 combinations of case number, intake stage, and allegation that appear in the data 2 or more times. This happens when there is more than one type of perpetrator for a single allegation, within a single report (intake stage) for a case.


## Check for duplicate rows by case number, intake stage, allegation, and perp

```{r}
allegations %>% 
  group_by(case_num, intake_stage, allegation, perp) %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases/Intake Stages/Allegations/Perp with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.), # 32
    `Number of Duplicate Rows` = sum(n)                                       # 36
  )
```

There are 32 combinations of case number, intake stage, allegation, and perpetrator that appear in the data 2 or more times. This happens when there is more than one perpetrator of the same type (But different perpetrator ID's) for a single allegation, within a single report (intake stage) for a case.


## Check for duplicate rows by all variables

```{r}
allegations %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of all vars with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.),   # 0
    `Number of Duplicate Rows by All Vars` = sum(n) # 0
  )
```

There are no complete duplicate rows.  

At this point, perp_id isn't meaningful in the absence of other differences between rows. Therefore, I'm going to drop rows that differ only by perp_id.

```{r}
allegations <- allegations %>% 
  group_by(case_num, intake_stage, allegation, perp) %>% 
  mutate(
    count = row_number(), # Counts rows by group
    dup   = count > 1     # TRUE if there is more than one row per group
  ) %>% 
  filter(!dup) %>% 
  select(case_num:perp)

about_data(allegations) # 1,051 observations and 4 variables
```

# Import APS [closure reason](http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/handbooks/APS/Files/APS_pg_2800.asp#APS_2900) data {#closure} 

```{r import_closure_reason}
col_info <- c( 
# "col_name",       "col_type"
  "case_num",       "text",
  "intake_stage",   "text",
  "closure_reason", "text")

# Import data
closure <- read_excel(
  path = path,
  sheet = "Closure Reason",
  col_names = col_info[seq(1, length(col_info), 2)],
  col_types = col_info[seq(2, length(col_info), 2)],
  skip = 7)

rm(col_info)

about_data(closure) # 747 observations and 3 variables
```


## Check for duplicate rows by case number

```{r}
closure %>% 
  group_by(case_num) %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.),         # 58
    `Number of Duplicate Rows by Case Number` = sum(n) # 68
  )
```


## Check for duplicate rows by case number and intake stage

```{r}
closure %>% 
  group_by(case_num, intake_stage) %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of Cases/Intake Stages with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.), # 0
    `Number of Duplicate Rows` = sum(n)                      # 0
  )
```

```{r}
about_data(closure) # 747 observations and 3 variables
```

# Import APS [disposition](http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/handbooks/APS/Files/APS_pg_2700.asp#APS_2700) data {#disposition}   

```{r import_allegation_disposition}
col_info <- c( 
# "col_name",    "col_type"
  "case_num",    "text",
  "allegation",  "text",
  "perp",        "text",
  "perp_id",     "text",
  "disposition", "text")

# Import data
disposition <- read_excel(
  path = path,
  sheet = "Allegation Disposition",
  col_names = col_info[seq(1, length(col_info), 2)],
  col_types = col_info[seq(2, length(col_info), 2)],
  skip = 6)

rm(col_info)

about_data(disposition) # 1,135 observations and 5 variables
```


## Drop final row - was a note in the excel sheet

```{r}
disposition <- disposition %>% slice(-n())
```


## Check for duplicate rows by all variables

```{r}
disposition %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of all vars with > 1 Rows` = nrow(.),   # 6
    `Number of Duplicate Rows by All Vars` = sum(n) # 6
  )
```

After manually checking the 6 duplicate rows, they appear to truly be complete duplicates. I will keep one row from each set of duplicates.

```{r}
disposition <- disposition %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  mutate(
    count = row_number(), # Counts rows by group
    dup   = count > 1     # TRUE if there is more than one row per group
  ) %>% 
  filter(!dup) %>% 
  select(case_num:disposition)

about_data(disposition) # 1,128 observations and 5 variables
```


## Is perp id unique to the person, or unique to the person/investigation?

(results hidden to protect participant privacy)

```{r eval=FALSE}
disposition %>% 
  group_by(perp_id) %>% 
  summarise(`Count of case_num by perp_id` = unique(case_num) %>% length()) %>% 
  filter(`Count of case_num by perp_id` > 1)
```

There are 53 perpetrator id’s that are associated with more than one case number. Below we inspect these cases (results hidden to protect participant privacy).

```{r eval=FALSE}
disposition %>% # Join with client_data to get name
  left_join(
    client_data %>% 
      group_by(case_num) %>% 
      mutate(count = row_number()) %>% 
      filter(count == 1) %>% # Keep one row per case_number
      select(case_num, full_name, intake_start),
    by = "case_num") %>% 
  group_by(perp_id) %>% 
  mutate(count_case_num = unique(case_num) %>% length()) %>% 
  filter(count_case_num > 1) %>% 
  arrange(perp_id, case_num) %>% 
  select(case_num, intake_start, perp_id, perp, full_name, allegation)
```

The perpetrator id is tied to a person and is reused across cases.
