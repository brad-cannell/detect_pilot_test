# Overview {#overview}

In this file, we analyze the APS reporting data we received from MedStar's legal compliance department.

Figure 1, below, illustrates MedStar’s current standard operating procedure for reporting suspected elder abuse and neglect. In the first step, the medic responds to a 911 call. He or she must use their experience and subjective judgement alone to determine if they believe elder abuse or neglect may be occurring. If they suspect elder abuse is occurring, they are required by [Texas law](https://www.txabusehotline.org/Login/Default.aspx), and MedStar’s standard operating procedure, to report the suspected abuse to [Texas’ statewide intake](https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Contact_Us/report_abuse.asp). They can make this report over the phone, or using an online web form. Finally, if the medic reports suspected elder abuse or neglect to APS, the procedure is for them to let the MedStar legal compliance department know that the report was made. Of course, at each of these steps there is the potential for a breakdown in the process.

During the pilot study, all MedStar medics were given access to the pilot version of the DETECT screening tool through their Electronic Patient Care Reporting system (ePCR). In this analysis, we investigate all reports to APS in 2015 that were reported to the MedStar legal compliance department. We are primarily interested evaluating whether or not reports increased during the period of time that the pilot test occurred.

# Load packages and data {#load}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)
Sys.setenv(TZ = "US/Central")
```

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(bfuncs)
```


## Load data

Reporting data from MedStar's compliance department. Cleaned in data_medstar_compliance_01_import.Rmd

```{r}
medstar_compliance <- feather::read_feather("/Volumes/sph_research/Detect/medstar_compliance.feather")
```










# Exploratory data analysis {#eda}

## Total reports in 2015

```{r}
nrow(medstar_compliance) # 49
```


## Number of reports during DETECT pilot

```{r}
medstar_compliance %>% 
  filter(detect_pilot == TRUE) %>% 
  nrow() # 14
```


## Calculate time difference

Here we calculate the difference in days between the variables reported (to APS) and created (recorded with MedStar compliance).

```{r}
medstar_compliance <- medstar_compliance %>%
  mutate(
    report_interval = lubridate::interval(reported, created),
    interval_days   = report_interval / lubridate::ddays()
  )
```

Update 2018-09-11: dplyr does not currently support lubridate periods and intervals. Leaving the report interval column in the data causes data management problems later. Dropping it here.

```{r}
medstar_compliance <- select(medstar_compliance, -report_interval)
```


## Days between report and compliance

Mean and maximum number of days between the report to APS and a record of that report appearing in the MedStar compliance data:

```{r mean_max}
medstar_compliance %>% 
  summarise(
    `Mean Days` = mean(interval_days) %>% round(1), # 3.5
    `Max Days`  = max(interval_days) %>% round() # 22
  )
```


## Group by day and count number of reports

```{r eval=FALSE}
medstar_reports_by_day <- medstar_compliance %>% 
  group_by(reported) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  print()
```

Results  hidden to protect participant privacy.


## Group by month and count number of reports

```{r rows.print=12}
medstar_reports_by_month <- medstar_compliance %>% 
  mutate(month = format(reported, "%m")) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  count() %>%
  
  # Add January
  ungroup() %>% 
  add_row(month = "01", n = 0) %>%
  arrange(month) %>% 
  
  # Add month names
  mutate(
    month = ordered(
      month,
      labels = c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
      "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December")
    )
  ) %>% 
  print()
```


## Min and max report months

```{r}
medstar_reports_by_month %>% 
  summarise(
    `Min Reports`       = min(n), # 0
    `Min Reports Month` = month[n == `Min Reports`], # January
    `Max Reports`       = max(n), # 13
    `Max Reports Month` = month[n == `Max Reports`] # October
  )
```


## Distribution of reporting mode (phone / electronic / both)

```{r}
medstar_compliance %>% 
  summarise(
    `Phone Only`      = sum(phone == "Yes" & electronic == "No"), # 33
    `Electronic Only` = sum(phone == "No" & electronic == "Yes"), # 12
    `Both`            = sum(phone == "Yes" & electronic == "Yes") # 4
  )
```

# Figure 1. MedStar reports to APS by month {#figure1}

## Preliminary variable management

### Count number of reports by day

```{r}
reports_date <- medstar_compliance %>%
  group_by(reported) %>%
  count() %>%
  rename(count_date = n)
```


### Count number of reports by month

```{r}
reports_month <- medstar_compliance %>% 
  mutate(month = format(reported, "%m")) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  count() %>% 
  rename(count_month = n) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # Add January
  add_row(month = "01", count_month = 0) %>%
  arrange(month) %>%
  
  # Add month names
  mutate(month = ordered(month,
    labels = c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
      "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))) %>%
  
  # Add POSIXct variable corresponding to the middle of each month for merging
  # with the daily data
  mutate(
    reported = as.POSIXct(c("2015-01-15", "2015-02-15", "2015-03-15", 
      "2015-04-15", "2015-05-15", "2015-06-15", "2015-07-15", "2015-08-15", 
      "2015-09-15", "2015-10-15", "2015-11-15", "2015-12-15")),
    tag = 1
  )
```


### Merge reports_date and reports_month

```{r}
reports_merge <- reports_date %>%
  full_join(reports_month, by = "reported") %>% 
  arrange(reported) %>% 
  replace_na(list(count_date = 0))
```


### Grab rows with values for count_month - need for geom_line

```{r}
rows <- which(!is.na(reports_merge["count_month"]))
```


### Create breaks at each month for the x axis

```{r}
mnth_breaks <- reports_merge$reported[rows]
```

```{r}
reports_merge %>% 
  filter(!is.na(count_month)) %>% 
  pull(reported)
```


## Create figure

```{r}
fig_medstar_reports_to_aps_2015 <- ggplot() +
  geom_rug(
    aes(x = reported), 
    data  = reports_merge, 
    color = "blue"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = reported, y = count_month), 
    data  = reports_merge %>% filter(!is.na(count_month)),
    size  = 1
  ) +
  geom_line(
    aes(x = reported, y = count_month),
    data  = reports_merge %>% filter(!is.na(count_month)),
    group = 1,
    size  = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2015-09-17")),
    col      = "red", 
    alpha    = 0.5, 
    linetype = 2
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2015-10-27")),
    col      = "red", 
    alpha    = 0.5, 
    linetype = 2
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Number of Reports to APS"
  ) +
  scale_x_datetime(
    name   = "Month", 
    breaks = reports_merge %>% filter(!is.na(count_month)) %>% pull(reported), 
    labels = format(mnth_breaks, "%b")
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.text  = element_text(size = 8)
  )

fig_medstar_reports_to_aps_2015
```

1. The red dashed lines indicate the time period in which the DETECT screening tool was used in MedStar's EPCR.   

2. The blue rug plot shows the marginal distribution of individual reports to APS.

# Summary {#summary}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2015, there were 49 total reports to APS that MedStar's compliance office was made aware of. On average, MedStar compliance was made aware of reports 3.5 days after they occurred; however, in some cases MedStar compliance was not informed of the report for 22 days.

The DETECT screening tool was used in MedStar's EPCR from 2015-09-17 to 2015-10-26. **During that time 14 reports were made to APS.** January had the lowest number of reports (0), and October had the highest number of reports (13). Of the 49 total reports, 33 were made by phone only, 12 were made electronically only, and 4 were made by phone and electronically.


## Limitations

The primary limitation here is that we are unable to determine if reports to APS increased generally, or if reports to APS remained constant, and only the proportion of reports that compliance was made aware of increased.
