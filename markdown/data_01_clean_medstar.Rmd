# Overview {#overview}

In this file, we import the raw data files received from MedStar and do some basic data checks. 

Additionally, we renumber the incident call numbers and incident PCR numbers so that they cannot be linked back to MedStar's database. This is part of deidentifying the data.

**This file also contains a descriptive analysis used for IRB documents (line 1011).**

In our IRB continuing review documents we have to report on subject enrollment. Specifically, we have to report the total number of subjects in our study, and demographic information about those subjects. We are interpreting this to mean all unique MedStar patients treated during the pilot phase of the DETECT project.

We aren’t putting this in a separate analysis file because:     
1. It’s very brief    
2. That would require creating a separate data file that will never be used for any other reason

In this file we import the following files:

1. **response_ids.feather** - These are the response id numbers that correspond to 911 responses where a report was made to APS during the DETECT pilot phase and MedStar compliance was made aware of the report. This data was created in analysis_medstar_reports_to_aps_2015.Rmd.

2. **DETECT_DATA_PIVOT.xlsx** - Data from MedStar that contains all uses of the DETECT screening tool.   

3. **DETECT-Patient-Data_2017-07-19_144931.xlsx** - Data from MedStar that includes demographic and health information for all patients who where age >= 65 and treated during the pilot period.


# Key variable definitions 

It's important to understand the meaning of patient identification variables in the data, and the relationship between patient identification variables across both MedStar datasets. The following diagram shows how people are identified in the MedStar data:

![](../images/medstar_detect_identifiers.png)

However, after manually checking the datasets we found that the terms "Incident" and "Response" are used inconsistently between files. 

* In **DETECT_DATA_PIVOT.xlsx** (data that contains the DETECT screening information):

    - **Response number** is unique to the incident/response (#2 in the diagram). In cases where there was more than one person screened at an incident/response, the response number is not unique to the person/screening (#3 and #4 in the diagram). This number matches incident call number in DETECT-Patient-Data_2017-07-19_144931.xlsx.
    
    - **Response date** is the date that MedStar responded to the 911 call and filled out the DETECT screening tool.
    
* In **DETECT-Patient-Data_2017-07-19_144931.xlsx** (demographic and health data):

    - **Date entered** is the date that MedStar responded to the 911 call and filled out the DETECT screening tool.
    
    - **Incident call number** is unique to the incident/response (#2 in the diagram). In cases where there was more than one person screened at an incident/response, the incident call number is not unique to the person/screening (#3 and #4 in the diagram). This number matches response number in DETECT_DATA_PIVOT.xlsx.
    
    - **Incident PCR number** is unique to the person/DETECT screening at a given incident/response. Below, we add this number to DETECT_DATA_PIVOT.xlsx. NOTE: No two people should have the same incident PCR number; however, a single person may have multiple incident PCR numbers if they were treated by MedStar on multiple occasions.
    
In order to be consistent and reduce confusion, after importing the data below, we will use the terminology from DETECT-Patient-Data_2017-07-19_144931.xlsx. That is:

# Import data
medstar_detect <- readxl::read_excel(
  path = "/Volumes/sph_research/Detect/DETECT_DATA_PIVOT.xlsx",
  col_names = col_info[seq(1, length(col_info), 2)],
  col_types = col_info[seq(2, length(col_info), 2)],
  skip = 1)
rm(col_info)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect) # 1,248 observations and 36 variables in the data
```


## Check for duplicate rows

First, check for entire duplicate rows

```{r}
medstar_detect %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n)
```

151003... Appears to have a duplicate row. Will drop.

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  mutate(
    count = row_number(), # Counts rows by group
    dup   = count > 1     # TRUE if there is more than one row per group
  ) %>% 
  filter(!dup) %>% 
  select(-count, -dup) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect) # 1,247 observations and 36 variables
```


## Check for duplicate response numbers

```{r}
medstar_detect %>% 
  group_by(response_num) %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) # 2 sets of duplicates (4 rows)
```


151011... Includes information about two people. A man and a woman with the same last name. Both over age 65. Keep both rows because they are not duplicates of each other. They are two separate screenings that occurred at a single 911 response.

151024... Includes information about two people. A man and a woman with the same last name. Both over age 65. Keep both rows because they are not duplicates of each other. They are two separate screenings that occurred at a single 911 response.

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect) # "1,247 observations and 36 variables"
```


## Separate name, address, and date of birth into multiple fields

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>%
  mutate(
    first_name     = stringr::str_extract(full_name, "^\\S*"),
    last_name      = stringr::str_extract(full_name, "\\S*$"),
    birth_mnth     = lubridate::month(dob),
    birth_day      = lubridate::day(dob),
    birth_year     = lubridate::year(dob),
    address_num    = stringr::str_extract(address, "^\\d{1,5}"),
    address_street = stringr::str_trim(str_replace(address, "^\\d{1,5}", "")))
```


## Set all "NULL" values to NA   

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, ~ {.[. == "NULL"] <- NA; .})
```


## Coerce selected character vectors (screening questions) to factors

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>%
  mutate_at(vars(unusual_odor36:adls61), factor)
```


## Check response id's

Check to see if all the response id's from the MedStar compliance data exist in the current data.   

```{r eval=FALSE}
response_ids %>% 
  anti_join(medstar_detect, by = "response_num") %>%  # 6 response numbers
  unique()
```


There are 6 responses id's in the MedStar compliance data that don't appear in the MedStar DETECT screening items data (results hidden to protect participant privacy). I have an email from MedStar from 2016-10-10 outlining the discrepancy. One response id had all nulls for the DETECT screening items. One response id could not be found in the query. The rest were ineligible for the DETECT screening tool because of age.

At this point, there should be 8 response id's from the compliance data that have a match in the DETECT screening tool data (results hidden to protect participant privacy).

```{r eval=FALSE}
response_ids %>% 
  semi_join(medstar_detect, by = "response_num") %>%  # 8 response numbers
  unique()
```


## Add a dataset identifier tag

Adding a variable that will allow me to tell which rows had a DETECT screening tool use (even if all NA) after I merge this data with the demographics data below.

```{r}
medstar_detect$detect_data <- 1
```


## Count rows, unique responses, and unique people

```{r}
medstar_detect %>% 
  mutate(person = paste(full_name, dob)) %>% 
  group_by(response_num, full_name) %>% 
  mutate(response_names = paste(response_num, full_name)) %>%  
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(
    `Total Rows` = n() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique 911 Responses` = unique(response_num) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique Response And Name` = unique(response_names) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique People` = unique(person) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ",")
  )
```

So, the MedStar detect screening data contains 1,247 total rows of data that correspond to 1,245 911 responses, 1,247 unique response/name combinations, and 1,141 unique people (assuming first name, last name, and age uniquely identifies people in this data).

**NOTE:** The count of unique people is not correct. Creating a unique identifier based on name a date of birth is complicated by data entry errors (i.e., misspelled names and mistyped dates of birth). We get an accurate count below.


## Rename response number

In order to be consistent and reduce confusion, we will use the terminology from DETECT-Patient-Data_2017-07-19_144931.xlsx.

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% rename(incident_call_number = response_num)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect) # 1,247 observations and 44 variables
```

[top](#top)










# Create a unique person identifier in DETECT screening data {#person-id-detect}

**First Attempt:** Assuming first name, last name, and date of birth uniquely identifies people in this data.

Leaving this for instructional purposes.

```{r}
# medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>%
#   mutate(person = paste(first_name, last_name, dob, sep = "-"))
```

```{r}
# person_key <- medstar_detect %>% 
#   select(person) %>% 
#   distinct() %>% # 40 rows
#   mutate(person_id = row_number())
```

```{r}
# medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
#   left_join(person_key, by = "person")
```

```{r}
# rm(person_key)
```


**Problem:** Unlike renumbering incident number, incident PCR number, perpetrator id, and crew id, creating a unique identifier based on name a date of birth is made more complicated by data entry errors (i.e., misspelled names and mistyped dates of birth). See an example below (results hidden to protect participant privacy).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# medstar_detect %>% 
#   filter(incident_call_number %in% c(151010195, 151023005)) %>% 
#   select(person, person_id, address)
```

This is clearly the same person with a misspelling in their last name. Yet, the method above treats them as two unique people. Therefore, we will use the RecordLinkage package to look for probabilistic matches.

```{r}
# medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% select(-person, -person_id)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect) # 1,247 observations and 44 variables
```


## Using the RecordLinkage package to find probabilistic matches

**Note:** I've checked with and without using address in the record linkage process. You get better results when you use address.

### Subset the variables used for record matching

Create a new data set (medstar_detect_for_compare) that contain only the subset of variables we want to use for linking records between MedStar and APS (i.e., first name, last name, birthdate)

```{r}
medstar_detect_for_compare <- medstar_detect %>% 
  select(
    first_name, last_name, birth_mnth, birth_day, birth_year, address
  ) %>% # 1,247 rows
  mutate(unique_spellings_dob = 
           paste(first_name, last_name, birth_mnth, birth_day, birth_year, 
                 address, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  distinct(unique_spellings_dob, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # 1,145 rows
  arrange(unique_spellings_dob) %>% 
  select(-unique_spellings_dob)
```


### Add string comparitors

> String comparators measure the similarity between strings, usually with a similarity measure in
the range [0, 1], where 0 denotes maximal dissimilarity and 1 equality. This allows ‘fuzzy’ comparison patterns as displayed in the following example.
[Sariyar & Borg, 2010](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010/RJ-2010-017/RJ-2010-017.pdf)

Below we Compares each record in medstar_detect_for_compare to every other record in medstar_detect_for_compare until all records are compared. For example, id1 - id1, id1-id2, idn-idm. For each pair, a probability match is given for each variable (i.e., first name, last name, etc.). In this case, we are using the Jaro-Winkler distance as our comparison measure ( [Winkler, 1990](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED325505), [Wikipedia, 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)).

```{r}
rpairs_jar <- RecordLinkage::compare.dedup(
  dataset   = medstar_detect_for_compare, 
  strcmp    = c("first_name", "last_name", "address")
)
```

```{r}
rpairs_epiwt <- RecordLinkage::epiWeights(rpairs_jar)
```


## View potential matches and probability weights

Results hidden to protect participant privacy.

```{r}
weighted_pairs <- RecordLinkage::getPairs(rpairs_epiwt, max.weight = Inf, min.weight = 0.5)
```

```{r  eval=FALSE, rows.print=20}
weighted_pairs
```

After manual inspection, it looks like the first 19 pairs are the same people but with typos in their records.


## Just keep those 19 pairs

```{r}
matched_pairs <- weighted_pairs %>% 
  filter(id != "") %>% 
  slice(1:(19*2))
```


## Make a key

For each pair in the matched pairs data, give matching sequential numbers.

```{r}
matched_pairs_key <- matched_pairs %>% 
  mutate(
    dob = paste(birth_year, birth_mnth, birth_day, sep = "-") %>% as.Date(),
    person = paste(first_name, last_name, dob, address, sep = "-"),
    person_id = rep(1:(n()/2), each = 2)
  ) %>% 
  select(person_id, person)
```


## Merge person id numbers back with the medstar detect data

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  mutate(person = paste(first_name, last_name, dob, address, sep = "-"))
```

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  left_join(matched_pairs_key, by = "person")
```


## Now assign a person id to the remaining rows

These rows should either be perfect matches on name, dob and address, or they should be rows with no matches in the data.

```{r}
person_key <- medstar_detect %>% 
  filter(is.na(person_id)) %>% #1,214 rows
  select(person) %>% 
  distinct() %>% # 1,117
  mutate(person_id = row_number() + 19) # Add 19 because 1-19 were already assigned above.
```

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  left_join(person_key, by = "person")
```


## Data checks

```{r}
medstar_detect %>% 
  mutate(
    check_overlap = !is.na(person_id.x) & !is.na(person_id.y),
    check_missing = is.na(person_id.x) & is.na(person_id.y)
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Rows with two IDs` = sum(check_overlap),
    `Rows with no ID` = sum(check_missing)
  )
```


## Combine person_id.x and person_id.y into a single variable

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(person_id = max(person_id.x, person_id.y, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(-person_id.x, -person_id.y) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect) # 1,247 observations and 46 variables
```


## Double check results

* Make sure that each person id really represents 1, and only 1, person.     
* Make sure that each person has 1, and only 1, person id.     

```{r}
medstar_detect_for_compare <- medstar_detect %>% 
  select(first_name, last_name, birth_mnth, birth_day, birth_year, address, person_id) %>% # 1,247 rows
  mutate(name_dob_address_id = 
           paste(first_name, last_name, birth_mnth, birth_day, birth_year, address, person_id, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  distinct(name_dob_address_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # 1,145 rows
  arrange(name_dob_address_id) %>% 
  select(-name_dob_address_id)
```

```{r}
rpairs_jar <- RecordLinkage::compare.dedup(
  dataset   = medstar_detect_for_compare, 
  strcmp    = c("first_name", "last_name", "address")
)
```

```{r}
rpairs_epiwt <- RecordLinkage::epiWeights(rpairs_jar)
```


## View potential matches and probability weights

Results hidden to protect participant privacy.

```{r}
weighted_pairs <- RecordLinkage::getPairs(rpairs_epiwt, max.weight = Inf, min.weight = 0.5)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, rows.print=20}
weighted_pairs %>% 
  filter(id != "") %>% 
  select(person_id, everything(), -id)
```

All combinations above either already have the same person id or aren't matches. At this point, person id should uniquely identify individual people in the MedStar DETECT data.

```{r}
rm(matched_pairs, matched_pairs_key, medstar_detect_for_compare, person_key, 
   rpairs_epiwt, rpairs_jar, weighted_pairs)
```

```

```{r}

```


## Grab just the first part of two-part first names

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(first_name = stringr::str_extract(first_name, "^\\S*"))
```


## Check for duplicate rows

First, check for rows that are entirely duplicated

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% 
  arrange(!!! rlang::syms(names(medstar_demo))) %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n) # 387 groups of duplicates
```


I manually inspected the duplicate rows. They appear to be genuine duplicates. Below I will drop the duplicate rows.


```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  mutate(
    count = row_number(), # Counts rows by group
    dup   = count > 1     # TRUE if there is more than one row per group
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(!dup) %>% 
  select(-count, -dup)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_demo) # 99,311 observations and 16 variables
```


## Check for incident PCR numbers that correspond to more than one person

**NOTE:** No two people should have the same incident PCR number; however, a single person may have multiple incident PCR numbers if they were treated by MedStar on multiple occasions.

**NOTE:** There are multiple rows in this data for each person. Those rows that are complete duplicates were already dropped above. Because our purpose is just to see if there are any instances were a incident PCR number corresponds to more than one name, we are just going to keep one row per combination of incident PCR number and first name.

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% 
  group_by(incident_pcr_number, first_name) %>% 
  mutate(count = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(count == 1) %>% # 2,018 rows
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(
    `Rows grouped by PCR and Name` = n(),
    `Unique PCR numbers` = unique(incident_pcr_number) %>% length()
  )
```

The number of rows when grouped by incident PCR number and name (2,018) is the same as the number of unique incident PCR numbers. Therefore, each incident PCR number is associated with a single person. Again, however, any given person my have multiple incident PCR numbers if they were treated by MedStar more than once.


## Count rows, unique responses, and unique people

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(person = paste(first_name, last_name, age, sep = "_")) %>% 
  group_by(incident_call_number, first_name) %>% 
  mutate(incident_names = paste(incident_call_number, first_name, sep = "_")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(
    `Total Rows` = n() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique Incidents` = unique(incident_call_number) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique PCR` = unique(incident_pcr_number) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique Incident And Name` = unique(incident_names) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique People` = unique(person) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ",")
  )
```

So, the MedStar demographics and health data contains 99,311 total rows of data that correspond to 2,011 911 responses, 2,018 incident PCR numbers, 2,014 unique response/name combinations, and 1,776 unique people (assuming first name, last name, and age uniquely identifies people in this data).

**Note:** Creating a unique identifier based on name is complicated by data entry errors (i.e., misspelled names and mistyped dates of birth). We do a better job of identifying unique people in the section below.


## Why does "Unique PCR" and "Unique Incident And Name" Differ?

Theoretically, these should be the same. Below, we inspect the data to understand the discrepancy (results hidden to protect participant privacy).

```{r eval=FALSE}
medstar_demo %>% 
  
  # Count total rows for each PCR number
  group_by(incident_pcr_number) %>% 
  mutate(count_pcr = n()) %>% 
  
  # Count total rows for each combo of incident and name
  group_by(incident_call_number, first_name) %>% 
  mutate(incident_name_count = n()) %>% 
  
  # Where do they differ?
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(count_pcr != incident_name_count) %>% 
  
  # PCR number changes more frequently (2,108) than incident/name combos (2,104)
  # Keep one row per PCR number
  group_by(incident_pcr_number) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1)
```


There are 4 groups of incident call numbers that have multiple incident PCR numbers for the same person. For example:

incident_call_number | incident_pcr_number | first_name | last_name
-------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------
150917001            | 15000001            | John       | Smith
150917001            | 15000002            | John       | Smith

We spoke with MedStar on 2017-07-27. There are two reasons for multiple PCR numbers for a given incident number:

1. If there is more than one person treated at a given incident, they each get a unique PCR number, which does not apply to the cases above.

2. It could be an error caused by the chart being reopened to add more data. That appears to have happened some in our data. The dates, times, etc. are all identical. 

Therefore, for each group, we are going to keep only one incident PCR number. We will arbitrarily retain the lowest incident PCR number.


## Condense incident PCR numbers within combinations of incident call number and name

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  group_by(incident_call_number, first_name) %>% 
  mutate(incident_pcr_number = min(incident_pcr_number)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```


## Count rows, unique responses, and unique people

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(person = paste(first_name, last_name, age, sep = "_")) %>% 
  group_by(incident_call_number, first_name) %>% 
  mutate(incident_names = paste(incident_call_number, first_name, sep = "_")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(
    `Total Rows` = n() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique Incidents` = unique(incident_call_number) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique PCR` = unique(incident_pcr_number) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique Incident And Name` = unique(incident_names) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique People` = unique(person) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ",")
  )
```

And now the number of unique PCR numbers and unique combinations of incident call number and name are identical.


## Coerce selected character vectors to factors

# Create a unique person identifier in demographics and health data {#person-id-demo}

## Using the RecordLinkage package to find probabilistic matches

**Note:** I've checked with and without using address. You get better results when you use address.

```{r}
medstar_demo_for_compare <- medstar_demo %>% 
  select(first_name, last_name, age) %>% # 99,311 rows
  mutate(person_age = paste(first_name, last_name, age, sep = "_")) %>% 
  distinct(person_age, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # 1,816 rows
  arrange(person_age) %>% 
  select(-person_age)
```

```{r}
rpairs_jar <- RecordLinkage::compare.dedup(
  dataset   = medstar_demo_for_compare, 
  strcmp    = c("first_name", "last_name")
)
```

```{r}
rpairs_epiwt <- RecordLinkage::epiWeights(rpairs_jar)
```


## View potential matches and probability weights

Results hidden to protect participant privacy.

```{r}
weighted_pairs <- RecordLinkage::getPairs(rpairs_epiwt, max.weight = Inf, min.weight = 0.5)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, rows.print=20}
weighted_pairs %>% filter(id != "")
```

After manual inspection, it looks like most of the people in rows 1 through 40 are "duplicates" because of typos in the spelling of their name. 

I'm unsure of 
23 and 24 (id = 757 and 758)
27 and 28 (id = 1204 and 1205)
33 and 34 (id = 848 and 849)
35 and 36 (id = 1133 and 1161)

I'm going to look into these more closely in the MedStar demographics data.

```{r}
people_to_check <- weighted_pairs %>% 
  filter(id %in% c(" 757", " 758", "1204", "1205", " 848", " 849", "1133", "1161")) %>% 
  select(first_name, last_name, age) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate_all(as.character) %>% 
  mutate(age = age %>% as.numeric)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
medstar_demo %>% 
  semi_join(people_to_check, by = c("first_name", "last_name", "age")) %>% 
  select(first_name:drug_use, medical_surgery_hist, current_meds) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(first_name)
```

After looking these over manually, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that they are duplicates. So, it looks like 1-40 are duplicates except:
23 and 24 (id = 757 and 758)
27 and 28 (id = 1204 and 1205)
33 and 34 (id = 848 and 849)
35 and 36 (id = 1133 and 1161)


## Just keep those 16 pairs

```{r}
matched_pairs <- weighted_pairs %>% 
  filter(id != "") %>% 
  slice(1:40) %>% 
  filter(!(id %in% c(" 757", " 758", "1204", "1205", " 848", " 849", "1133", "1161")))
```


## Make a key

For each pair in the matched pairs data, give matching sequential numbers.

```{r}
matched_pairs_key <- matched_pairs %>% 
  mutate_all(as.character) %>% 
  mutate(
    age = as.numeric(age),
    person = paste(first_name, last_name, age, sep = "-"),
    person_id = rep(1:(n()/2), each = 2)
  ) %>% 
  select(person_id, person)
```


## Merge person id numbers back with the MedStar demographics data

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(person = paste(first_name, last_name, age, sep = "-"))
```

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  left_join(matched_pairs_key, by = "person")
```


## Now assign a person id to the remaining rows

These rows should either be perfect matches on name and age, or they should be rows with no matches in the data.

```{r}
person_key <- medstar_demo %>% 
  filter(is.na(person_id)) %>% # 97,219 rows
  select(person) %>% 
  distinct() %>% # 1,744
  mutate(person_id = row_number() + 16) # Add 16 because 1-16 were already assigned above.
```

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  left_join(person_key, by = "person")
```


## Data checks

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(
    check_overlap = !is.na(person_id.x) & !is.na(person_id.y),
    check_missing = is.na(person_id.x) & is.na(person_id.y)
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Rows with two IDs` = sum(check_overlap),
    `Rows with no ID` = sum(check_missing)
  )
```


## Combine person_id.x and person_id.y into a single variable

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(person_id = max(person_id.x, person_id.y, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(-person_id.x, -person_id.y) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_demo) # 99,311 observations and 18 variables
```


## Double check results

* Make sure that each person id really represents 1, and only 1, person.     
* Make sure that each person has 1, and only 1, person id.     

```{r}
medstar_demo_for_compare <- medstar_demo %>% 
  select(first_name, last_name, age, person_id) %>% # 99,311 rows
  mutate(name_age_id = paste(first_name, last_name, age, person_id, sep = "_")) %>% 
  distinct(name_age_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # 1,776 rows
  arrange(name_age_id) %>% 
  select(-name_age_id)
```

```{r}
rpairs_jar <- RecordLinkage::compare.dedup(
  dataset   = medstar_demo_for_compare, 
  strcmp    = c("first_name", "last_name")
)
```

```{r}
rpairs_epiwt <- RecordLinkage::epiWeights(rpairs_jar)
```


## View potential matches and probability weights

Results hidden to protect participant privacy.

```{r eval=FALSE, rows.print=20}
weighted_pairs <- RecordLinkage::getPairs(rpairs_epiwt, max.weight = Inf, min.weight = 0.5)
weighted_pairs %>% filter(id != "") %>% select(person_id, everything(), -id)
```

All combinations above either already have the same person id or aren't matches. At this point, person id should uniquely identify individual people in the MedStar demographics and health data.

```{r}
rm(matched_pairs, matched_pairs_key, medstar_demo_for_compare, people_to_check, 
   person_key, rpairs_epiwt, rpairs_jar, weighted_pairs)

# Descriptive analysis for IRB {#descriptives}

In our IRB continuing review documents we have to report on subject enrollment. Specifically, we have to report the total number of subjects in our study, and demographic information about those subjects. We are interpreting this to mean all unique MedStar patients treated during the pilot phase of the DETECT project.

We aren’t putting this in a separate analysis file because:     
1. It’s very brief    
2. That would require creating a separate data file that will never be used for any other reason    

## Take out the practice chart

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  filter(last_name != "Practice chart")
```


## Count rows, unique responses, and unique people

```{r}
medstar_demo %>%
  summarise(
    `Total Rows` = n() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique Incidents` = unique(incident_call_number) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique PCR` = unique(incident_pcr_number) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
    `Unique People` = unique(person_id) %>% length() %>% format(big.mark = ",")
  )
```

## Sex distribution

How many rows are missing a value for gender?

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% filter(is.na(gender)) %>% count() # 4 rows
```

Convert Not Documented and Not Available to missing

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(gender = fct_recode(medstar_demo$gender, NULL = "Unknown (Unable to Determine)"))
```

```{r}
medstar_demo %>% 
  group_by(person_id) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  bfuncs::freq_table()
```


## Race distribution

Convert Not Documented and Not Available to missing

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  mutate(race = fct_recode(medstar_demo$race, NULL = "Not Available", NULL = "Not Documented"))
```

Carry forward race within person

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  group_by(person_id) %>% 
  fill(race) %>% 
  fill(race, .direction = "up") %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Keep one row per unique person

```{r}

  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  bfuncs::freq_table()

# Deidentifify incident call numbers and incident PCR numbers {#deidentify}

## Incident call numbers

We need to create deidentified datasets for [NACJD](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/NACJD/index.html). For our analyses, it's important that incident call numbers in MedStar DETECT data match incident call numbers in the MedStar Demographics data; however, the actual numbers themselves shouldn't matter. Likewise, the original numbers have no relationship to the APS data.

Additionally, we need to make sure the response numbers for the MedStar legal compliance department get renumbered.

1. Select all the incident call numbers from the MedStar Demographics data and all the incident call numbers from the MedStar DETECT data. 

2. Combine them into a single column data frame. 

3. Remove duplicate incident call numbers.

4. Create a new incident call number that has no relationship to the MedStar data.

5. Join the new incident call number back to the MedStar Demographics data and the MedStar DETECT data.

6. Drop the original incident call numbers.

```{r}
icn_key <- medstar_demo %>% 
  select(incident_call_number) %>% 
  distinct() %>% # 2,011 rows
  bind_rows(
    medstar_detect %>% 
      select(incident_call_number) %>% 
      distinct() # 1,245 rows
  ) %>% # 3,256 rows
  distinct() %>% # 2,011 rows
  mutate(icn = row_number())
```

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  left_join(icn_key, by = "incident_call_number") %>% 
  select(incident_call_number, icn, everything())
```

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  left_join(icn_key, by = "incident_call_number") %>% 
  select(incident_call_number, icn, everything())
```

```{r}
medstar_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  select(-incident_call_number) %>% 
  rename(incident_call_number = icn)
```

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  select(-incident_call_number) %>% 
  rename(incident_call_number = icn)
```

```{r rows.print=14, eval=FALSE}
response_ids %>% 
  left_join(icn_key, by = c("response_num" = "incident_call_number"))
```


There are 5 responses id's in the MedStar compliance data that don't appear in the MedStar DETECT screening items data (results hidden to protect participant privacy). I have an email from MedStar from 2016-10-10 outlining the discrepancy. One response id had all nulls for the DETECT screening items. One response id could not be found in the query. The rest were ineligible for the DETECT screening tool because of age.

At this point, there should be 8 response id's from the compliance data that have a match in the DETECT screening tool data (results hidden to protect participant privacy).

However, there are 9 response numbers that match an incident call number from either the MedStar demographics data or the MedStar DETECT data (results hidden to protect participant privacy). Below we investigate.

```{r eval=FALSE}
response_ids %>% 
  left_join(icn_key, by = c("response_num" = "incident_call_number")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(icn)) %>% 
  anti_join(medstar_detect, by = c("icn" = "incident_call_number"))
```

After checking the 2016-10-10 email from MedStar, the person with icn 1882 was the person that had all NULL responses for DETECT. This accounts for the discrepancy (8/9 numbers). Next we will create a deidentified version of the incident call numbers that were present in the MedStar legal compliance data. All of the NA’s (numbers reported to compliance with no match in the MedStar DETECT or MedStar Demographics data) will be dropped. 

```{r}
medstar_compliance_deidentified <- response_ids %>% 
  left_join(icn_key, by = c("response_num" = "incident_call_number")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(icn)) %>% # 9 rows
  select(-response_num) %>% 
  rename(incident_call_number = icn)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_compliance_deidentified) # 9 observations and 1 variables
```

## Save deidentified version 

Save deidentified version of the incident call numbers reported to MedStar's legal compliance department.

## Incident PCR numbers

We need to create deidentified datasets for [NACJD](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/NACJD/index.html). For our analyses, it's important that incident PCR numbers in MedStar DETECT data match incident PCR numbers in the MedStar Demographics data; however, the actual numbers themselves shouldn't matter. Likewise, the original numbers have no relationship to the APS data.

1. Select all the incident PCR numbers from the MedStar Demographics data. Currently, there are no incident PCR numbers in the MedStar DETECT data. We add them below.

2. Combine them into a single column data frame. 

3. Remove duplicate incident PCR numbers.

4. Create a new incident PCR number that has no relationship to the MedStar data.

5. Join the new incident PCR number back to the MedStar Demographics data.

6. Drop the original incident PCR numbers.

```{r}
ipn_key <- medstar_demo %>%

# Add incident PCR number to MedStar DETECT data {#add-pcr}

* Incident PCR number does not currently exist in the DETECT data.

* There can be more than one person per incident call number in the DETECT data. That's the reason incident PCR numbers exist.

* Therefore, we will need to join incident PCR number to the DETECT data by incident call number and name.

```{r}
medstar_detect <- medstar_detect %>% 
  left_join(
    medstar_demo %>%
      select(incident_call_number, incident_pcr_number, first_name) %>% 
      group_by(incident_pcr_number) %>% 
      distinct(), # Only keep unique PCR numbers: 2,014
    by = c("incident_call_number", "first_name")
  ) %>% 
  select(response_date, incident_call_number, incident_pcr_number, everything())
```


## Count rows, unique responses, and unique people

# Merge the screening data with the demographics and health data {#merge}

* The MedStar DETECT data has 1,247 unique DETECT screenings - 1 per PCR number

* The MedStar demographics and health data has 99,311 observations for 2,014 unique incident / person combinations - 1 per PCR number

* Each PCR number in the DETECT screening data should have a matching PCR number in the demographics data 

## Check to make sure PCR numbers match between datasets

```{r}
medstar_detect %>% anti_join(medstar_demo, by = "incident_pcr_number") # 0
```

Every DETECT screen has a match in the demographics and health file.


## Merge data

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_demo %>% 
  left_join(medstar_detect, by = "incident_pcr_number")
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect_demo) # 99,311 observations and 64 variables
```


## Data checks

Count the number of differences that between variables that appear in both datasets.

The `na.rm = TRUE` is needed because not every eligible older adult that MedStar treated received the DETECT screening. Those that did not have `NA` for every variable that comes from the DETECT data.

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  summarise(
    `Different incident numbers` = sum(incident_call_number.x != incident_call_number.y, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Different first` = sum(first_name.x != first_name.y, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Different last` = sum(last_name.x != last_name.y, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Different age` = sum(age.x != age.y, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Keep on incident number variable and one first name variable only

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  select(-incident_call_number.y, -first_name.y) %>% 
  rename(first_name = first_name.x, incident_call_number = incident_call_number.x)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect_demo) # 99,311 observations and 62 variables
```


## Different last names

(results hidden to protect participant privacy)

```{r eval=FALSE}
medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  filter(last_name.x != last_name.y) %>% 
  group_by(incident_pcr_number) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  select(incident_pcr_number, starts_with("first_name"), starts_with("last_name"), everything())
```

* The other 4 appear to be true matches, where:

    - There was a slight mispelling
    
    - They had a two-name type name. For example, something like "St John"" in the demographics data and "John" in the DETECT data.

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect_demo) # 99,309 observations and 62 variables
```


## Keep one last name variable

Last name x looks like it has more complete information.

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  select(-last_name.y) %>% 
  rename(last_name = last_name.x)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect_demo) # 99,309 observations and 61 variables
```


## Different ages

(results hidden to protect participant privacy)

```{r eval=FALSE}
medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  filter(age.x != age.y) %>% 
  group_by(incident_pcr_number) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  select(incident_pcr_number, age.x, age.y, everything())
```

Most of these differences appear to be off by rounding errors. Additionally, not every person in the data has a value for age.y. Therefore, we will just keep age.x


## Keep one age variable

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  select(-age.y) %>% 
  rename(age = age.x)
```

```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect_demo) # 99,309 observations and 60 variables
```

The demographics and health data is now linked to the DETECT screening data. There are some instances when more than one person was screened at a given incident. However, each incident PCR number is linked to a unique screening - if one exists.










# Create a unique person identifier {#person}

Assuming first name, last name, and age uniquely identifies people in this data.

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_detect_demo %>%
  mutate(person = paste(first_name, last_name, age, sep = "_"))
```

```{r}
person_key <- medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  select(person) %>% 
  distinct() %>% # 1,775 rows
  mutate(person_id = row_number())
```

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_detect_demo %>% 
  left_join(person_key, by = "person")
```

```{r}
medstar_detect_demo <- medstar_detect_demo %>% select(-person)
```

```{r}
rm(person_key)
```


## Data checks

```{r}
sum(is.na(medstar_detect_demo$person_id)) # 0
```

## Check for individual people that have more than one person id because of misspellings.

```{r}

```


```{r}
about_data(medstar_detect_demo) # 99,309 observations and 61 variables
```


Check this. Do I need to use record linkage to identify unique people?
